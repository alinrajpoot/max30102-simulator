# Frequently Asked Questions

Common questions and answers about the MAX30102 Simulator.

## General Questions

### What is the MAX30102 Simulator?

The MAX30102 Simulator is a high-fidelity software simulator that generates realistic photoplethysmography (PPG) data and mimics the behavior of a real MAX30102 pulse oximeter sensor. It's designed for testing AI platforms, medical device software, and research applications without requiring physical hardware.

### Who is this simulator for?

- **Developers** testing health monitoring applications
- **Researchers** studying physiological signal processing
- **Educators** teaching biomedical engineering or signal processing
- **Medical device companies** validating their software
- **AI/ML engineers** training models on physiological data

### Is this a replacement for real medical devices?

`No.` This is a simulation tool for development and testing purposes only. It should not be used for actual medical diagnosis, treatment, or patient monitoring. Always use certified medical devices for clinical applications.

## Installation & Setup

### What are the system requirements?

- **Python**: 3.8 or higher
- **RAM**: Minimum 4GB, 8GB recommended
- **Storage**: 100MB free space
- **Operating System**: Windows 10+, macOS 10.15+, or Linux

### Why use a virtual environment?

Virtual environments prevent package conflicts between different Python projects. They ensure the simulator's dependencies don't interfere with other Python applications on your system.

```bash
# Create and activate virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # Linux/macOS
venv\Scripts\activate     # Windows
```

### The installation fails with dependency errors. What should I do?

First, ensure you're using Python 3.8 or higher. Then try:

```bash
# Update pip first
pip install --upgrade pip

# Install with no cache
pip install -r requirements.txt --no-cache-dir

# If specific packages fail, install them individually
pip install numpy scipy pyyaml pydantic
```

## Usage & Operation

### How do I change the sample rate?

Modify the `config/default.yaml` file:

```yaml
sensor:
  sample_rate: 500 # Change from default 1000 to 500 Hz
```

Or programmatically:

```python
from src.simulator.data_generator import DataGenerator
generator.set_sample_rate(500)  # 500 Hz
```

### Can I run multiple clients simultaneously?

`Yes.` The server supports multiple concurrent clients. The default maximum is 5 clients, but you can adjust this in the configuration:

```yaml
tcp_server:
  max_clients: 10 # Increase from default 5
```

### How do I simulate specific medical conditions?

Use the pre-defined scenarios:

```bash
# Command line
python examples/client_example.py --scenario heart_attack --duration 30

# Programmatically
client.set_scenario('heart_attack')
```

### What's the difference between activities and medical conditions?

- **Activities**: Normal physiological states like resting, walking, running
- **Medical Conditions**: Pathological states like heart attack, shock, anxiety

Activities represent normal variations, while medical conditions simulate emergency situations.

## Data & Signals

### What data does the simulator generate?

The simulator produces:

- **Raw PPG waveforms** (red and infrared LED signals)
- **Calculated vital signs** (heart rate, SpO2)
- **Metadata** (timestamp, activity, condition)
- **Signal quality indicators**

### Are the PPG signals medically accurate?

The signals are `physiologically plausible` but not clinically validated. They contain realistic:

- Cardiac pulsatile components
- Respiratory modulation
- Motion artifacts
- Sensor noise patterns

However, they are synthetic signals and should not be used for medical diagnosis.

### How are heart rate and SpO2 calculated?

- **Heart Rate**: Derived from the PPG waveform characteristics with added physiological variability
- **SpO2**: Calculated using a simplified ratio-of-ratios method between red and IR signals

```python
# Simplified SpO2 calculation
R = (ac_red / dc_red) / (ac_ir / dc_ir)
spo2 = 110.0 - 25.0 * R  # Empirical relationship
```

### Why do red and IR signals look different?

This mimics real MAX30102 behavior:

- **Different absorption**: Hemoglobin absorbs red and infrared light differently
- **Different baseline**: IR typically has better signal-to-noise ratio
- **Motion artifacts**: Affect signals slightly differently

## Technical Details

### How does the TCP protocol work?

The simulator uses a simple JSON-over-TCP protocol:

- **Port**: 8888 (configurable)
- **Encoding**: UTF-8 JSON messages
- **Delimiter**: Newline characters between messages
- **Real-time streaming**: Continuous data flow

### Can I use this with programming languages other than Python?

`Yes.` Any language that can create TCP sockets and parse JSON can connect to the simulator. Examples available in the documentation show Python, but you can implement clients in C++, Java, JavaScript, C#, etc.

### How resource-intensive is the simulator?

- **CPU**: Moderate usage, depends on sample rate (10-30% for 1000 Hz)
- **Memory**: ~50-100MB for the server
- **Network**: ~80 KB/s at 1000 Hz sample rate

### What's the maximum sample rate supported?

The simulator can theoretically support up to 3200 Hz (the MAX30102 hardware maximum), but practical limits depend on your hardware. For most applications, 100-500 Hz is sufficient.

## Customization & Extension

### How do I create custom scenarios?

Add to `config/scenarios.json`:

```json
"my_custom_scenario": {
  "description": "My custom medical scenario",
  "physiological": {
    "heart_rate_bpm": 100,
    "spo2_percent": 95,
    "respiratory_rate": 20,
    "pulse_amplitude_red": 12000
  }
}
```

### Can I modify the physiological models?

`Yes.` You can extend the `PhysiologicalModel` class:

```python
class CustomPhysiologicalModel(PhysiologicalModel):
    def _apply_condition_effects(self):
        # Add custom condition handling
        if self.state.condition == 'my_custom_condition':
            self.state.heart_rate_bpm = self._calculate_custom_hr()
        super()._apply_condition_effects()
```

### How do I add new types of noise or artifacts?

Extend the `DataGenerator` class:

```python
class CustomDataGenerator(DataGenerator):
    def _add_custom_noise(self, signal: float) -> float:
        # Add custom noise types
        custom_noise = self._generate_custom_noise_pattern()
        return signal + custom_noise
```

## Troubleshooting

### The server starts but clients can't connect

1. **Check the port**: Verify the server and client are using the same port
2. **Check the host**: Use `0.0.0.0` to listen on all interfaces
3. **Firewall**: Ensure the port isn't blocked by firewall
4. **Network**: For remote connections, ensure proper network configuration

### I'm getting unrealistic physiological values

1. **Validate parameters**: Ensure parameters are within physiological ranges
2. **Check scenarios**: Verify scenario definitions in `config/scenarios.json`
3. **Reset to defaults**: Use the `reset` command to return to known good state

### The data seems too perfect/clean

Realistic noise and artifacts are added by default. If signals seem too clean:

- Increase the `noise_level` parameter
- Increase `motion_artifact_probability`
- Add custom noise patterns

### Performance is poor with high sample rates

- Reduce the sample rate in configuration
- Ensure you're using efficient client code (buffered reads)
- Close unused client connections
- Monitor system resources for bottlenecks

## Medical & Safety

### Can I use this for medical device testing?

`For development and testing only.` While the simulator is useful for software testing during development, final medical device validation should use real hardware and clinical testing following appropriate regulatory guidelines.

### Are the medical scenarios clinically accurate?

The scenarios are `educationally accurate` but not clinically validated. They represent common physiological patterns seen in these conditions but are simplified for simulation purposes.

### What disclaimers should I include when using this simulator?

Always include appropriate disclaimers:

- "This software is for development and testing purposes only"
- "Not for medical diagnosis or treatment"
- "Always consult healthcare professionals for medical advice"
- "Simulated data may not represent real clinical scenarios"

## Integration & Deployment

### Can I integrate this with my existing application?

`Yes.` The TCP interface makes integration straightforward. Your application can connect as a client and receive real-time data just like it would from hardware.

### How do I deploy this in a production environment?

1. **Containerize**: Use Docker for consistent deployment
2. **Configuration**: Adjust parameters for your environment
3. **Monitoring**: Add health checks and logging
4. **Security**: Consider network security for exposed ports

### Can this run on embedded systems?

The simulator requires Python and has moderate resource requirements. It can run on capable embedded systems like Raspberry Pi, but for resource-constrained devices, you might need to:
